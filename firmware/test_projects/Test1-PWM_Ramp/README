Test1-PWM_Ramp 

Notes:

Using perhipherals UART1 and MCCP1 I have a PWM signal that is swept from 0 to
100% duty cycle and a uart that's going to my computer for debugging. There
were some issues getting the configurations setup right.

Oscillator is set as primary oscillator with a 32MHz crystal.

This system has an issue with starting up. I have to hit the reset button for
it work. Not sure what's up. I have the brownout bit enabled.
